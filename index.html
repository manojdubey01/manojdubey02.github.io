            <p>Become My devotee, always think of Me, act for Me, worship Me, and offer all homage unto Me. Surrender unto Me alone. Do not fear sinful reactions. When a person dies, what is it that leaves when people say, "He left the body?" That, which leaves, is the 'real thing' and whatever is left behind is the 'packing'. What you see with your physical eyes is the packing and the material (Soul or Atma) is within. There are varieties of packings. Some are in the form of a tree, some in the form of a donkey, some in the form of a man or a woman, etc., but the material, the content within each is the same. The packing can be in any form; it can even be rotten but a businessman is not really concerned with the outer packing, he is only concerned with the material within. Similarly, you should do the darshan of that material (the Self, the Lord) within the packing (body).</p>

            <h4>Inner Peace</h4>
            <p>Peace with KRISHNA is the foundation for peace in every other area of our lives. We can have a lot of things in life, but if we don't have peace, we're never going to truly enjoy our lives the way KRISHNA intended. "Pursue" is a strong word. It requires action and doing whatever it takes to maintain peace in our lives. It means not always getting "our way" or having the last word in an argument. It requires us to trust KRISHNAd even more with the people in our lives. But it's all worth it. </p>

            <p>The birth in which Love, Knowledge and Mischief all come together is considered as the birth of Lord Krishna. Today, on Lord Krishna’s Birthday, all of you must take a Sankalpa to read the Bhagavad Gita. It would appear from reading the Srimad Bhagavatam that the times of the Lord were filled with fun, happiness, love and devotion. But, along with this there is a lot of vairagya (dispassion) as well. If you wish to understand dispassion, you should refer the Srimad Bhagavatam.</p>

            <p>When we say Krishna, the essence of who he is, he is an irrepressible child, a terrible prankster, an enchanting flute player, a graceful dancer, an irresistible lover, a truly valiant warrior, a ruthless vanquisher of his foes, a man who left a broken heart in every home, an astute statesman and kingmaker, , a thorough gentleman, a yogi of the highest order, and the most colorful incarnation. To explore his path playfully, you need a heart full of love, a joyful mind, and a vibrant body.</p>
